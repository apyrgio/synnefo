Upgrade to Synnefo v0.17
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgrade Steps
=============

The upgrade to v0.17 consists of the following steps:

0. Install the latest Synnefo, Archipelago and Ganeti packages. For the
   following steps, the Cyclades API must be down.

1. Run the migrations for the Cyclades DB:

   .. code-block:: console

     cyclades.host$ snf-manage migrate db

2. Update the names of Archipelago volumes:

   .. code-block:: console

     cyclades.host$ /usr/lib/synnefo/tools/rename_unique_name_of_disks \
                      --parallel


   The ``--parallel`` switch is optional, but it will greatly improve the
   script's running time.

3. Create helper VMs in all Ganeti clusters.

   Helper VMs are required for the deletion of detachable volumes. These helper
   VMs must be attributed to a user, and thus an admin account must be created.
   The account can be the same as the one used for the upload of the images.

   In order to facilitate the creation of helper VMs, we have created an
   snf-manage command for this purpose:

   .. code-block:: console

     cyclades.host$ snf-manage helper-servers-sync --flavor <flavor_id> \
                      --image <image_id> --user <admin_user_id> \
                      --password *****


   The above script will create a helper server in all online Ganeti clusters
   and will immediately shut it down so that it reserves no resources.

   .. note::

     You must choose a flavor which has an Archipelago disk template.
